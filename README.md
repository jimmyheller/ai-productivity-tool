## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.local.example` and add your API keys:
   ```
   # Clerk Authentication (get from https://clerk.com)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

   # OpenAI API key for AI features
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_...

   # Notion API (optional)
   NOTION_TOKEN=secret_...
   NOTION_DATABASE_ID=...
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## How It Works

## Clerk Authentication Setup

4. Under "API Keys", copy your Publishable Key and Secret Key
5. Add these to your `.env.local` file
6. Make sure to configure your redirect URLs in the Clerk dashboard:

   - Add your production URLs when deploying

## Notes on Notion Integration
